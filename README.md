# Data Science Tooling For Racket

This project is a work in progress and is not currently intended to be shared with others. You are, however, welcome to snoop around. Eventually, this will evolve into a package of convenience functions for data science: data cleaning, wrangling, summarizing, and exploration. 

Many functions contained within are inspired by functionality commonly available in more statistically-oriented software packages such as R, numpy/scipy, and Matlab/Octave. This all began because I wanted the R function `aggregate` in Racket.

## Installation and Usage
Currently, you need to load the file data-science.rkt, after which the various functions can be used for exploring your data. There is currently no documentation for these functions. If you're here snooping around, you'll have to read the comments in the code to find out what's going on.
