# Data Science Tooling For Racket

This project is a work in progress and is not currently intended to be shared with others. You are, however, welcome to snoop around. Eventually, this will evolve into a package of convenience functions for data science: data cleaning, wrangling, summarizing, and exploration. 

Many functions contained within are inspired by functionality commonly available in more statistically-oriented software packages such as R, numpy/scipy, and Matlab/Octave. This all began because I wanted the R function `aggregate` in Racket.

## Installation
The data-science package is not currently registered in Racket's package catalog. It can, however, be installed directly from GitHub via raco:

``` racket
raco pkg install https://github.com/n3mo/data-science.git
```

# Usage

## Statistical Tests and Models
A host of statistical tests and models will be supported, including things such as multiple linear regression, t tests, chi-squared tests, ANOVAs, etc.

### Linear Model

``` racket
(linear-model xs y)
```

Estimates simple and multiple linear regression for independent variable(s) *xs* and dependent variable *y*. Returns a list containing `'(intercept coefficient ...)`, with one coefficient for every independent (predictor) variable in *xs*.  For simple linear regression, *xs* should be a single list of observations. For multiple regression, *xs* should be a list-of-lists containing independent variables arranged by "columns". Observed values of the dependent variable should be passed as *y*.

**TODO: Provide p-value estimates, residuals, etc.**

Example: Simple Linear Regression

``` racket
(require math)

;;; Independent variable
(define xs (range 100))
;;; Generate some noisy dependent variable data
(define ys (map + xs (sample (normal-dist 0 30) 100)))

;;; Check the coefficients (intercept slope)
(linear-model xs y)

;;; Plot the raw data and the model
(require plot)
(let* ([coef (linear-model xs ys)]
       [slope (cadr coef)]
       [intercept (car coef)])
  (plot (list (points (map vector xs ys))
	      (function (Î» (x) (+ (* x slope) intercept))))))
```

Example: Multiple Linear Regression

``` racket
;;; First independent variable
(define x1 '(52 59 67 73 64 74 54 61 65 46 72))
;;; Second independent variable
(define x2 '(173 184 194 211 196 220 188 188 207 167 217))
;;; Dependent variable
(define y '(132 143 153 162 154 168 137 149 159 128 166))
;;; Fit the model
(linear-model (map list x1 x2) y)

;; --> '(89144774/2876185 2477588/2876185 963117/2876185)
```

Example: Multiple Linear Regression With Interactions. Individual predictors represent main effects. The interaction between predictors is their product

``` racket
;;; First independent variable
(define x1 '(52 59 67 73 64 74 54 61 65 46 72))
;;; Second independent variable
(define x2 '(173 184 194 211 196 220 188 188 207 167 217))
;;; The interaction of x1 and x2 is their product
(define interaction (map * x1 x2))
;;; Dependent variable
(define y '(132 143 153 162 154 168 137 149 159 128 166))
;;; Fit the model
(linear-model (map list x1 x2 interaction) y)

;; --> '(1054612228677/92932149757 106305446023/92932149757 41389810584/92932149757 -295039649/185864299514)

;;; Let's see the approximate decimal values
(map exact->inexact (linear-model (map list x1 x2 interaction) y))

;; --> '(11.348195769005791 1.1439038728897226 0.4453766612762809 -0.0015873927901779573)

```

## Split->Apply->Combine
`data-science` provides a collection of ultility functions for breaking your data into meaningful pieces, applying functions to each piece, and then recombining the results. In fact, the filter/map/apply approach of lisp-like languages is well suited to such tasks. However, with complex analyses, commands can grow quite complex and cumbersome, and can mask their intended purpose. The following functions provide convenient short-hand procedures that aim to be *expressive, yet concise*.

### $ (Column-indexing)

``` racket
($ lst index)
```

Returns a "column" of data from a list-of-lists *lst*. Column selection is controlled by *index,* which can be either a number or a symbol. If *index* is a number, the corresponding column is returned from all rows of *lst*. If *index* is a symbol, then the first row of *lst* is assumed to be a header containing named fields of each column. In this situation, $ returns the corresponding column of data identified by the column name, *excluding the first row*--that is, the header name is **not** part of the return value.

Examples:

``` racket
;;; Numerical indexing
(define my-data '((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12)))
($ my-data 0)
;; --> '(1 4 7 10)

;;; Indexing by name
(define my-data '((age rank id) (21 1 100) (18 2 101) (32 1 102) (19 4 103)))
($ my-data 'rank)
;; --> '(1 2 1 4)
```
